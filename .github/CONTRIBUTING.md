### Finding an Issue  

- Visit the Issues tab in the repository.  
- Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`.  
- Leave a comment on the issue you'd like to work on, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  

### Creating an Issue  

If you spot a bug or have an idea that isn’t already listed:  

1. Open a new issue and use the appropriate template (e.g., Bug Report, Feature Request).  
2. Be clear and concise in your description.  
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers before proceeding.

   ```  
3. Create a new branch for your changes:  
   ```bash

   ```  
4. Follow the steps in the project’s README to set up your environment.

1. Push your branch to your forked repository:  
   ```bash  
   git push origin your-branch-name  
   ```  
2. Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the repository's `main` branch.

- A maintainer will review your changes. This may take some time—thank you for your patience!  
- If changes are requested, you can update your PR by pushing to the same branch.  

Remember, reviews are meant to ensure the quality and consistency of the project, not to criticize you personally.
